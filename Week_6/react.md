1. Create a new react app called example-app
  - Open terminal and type: npx create-react-app example-app

2. React Commands
 - npm start: starts dev server
 - npm run build: bundles the app into static files for production
 - npm test: starts the test runner
 - npm run eject: The eject command is about removing create-react-app, and replacing it with all the dependencies to make your app work. Doing this will disable future updates from the create-react-app group and is an irreversible change.
