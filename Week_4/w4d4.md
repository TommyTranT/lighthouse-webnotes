# Responsive Design

Make your web look good on any device.

CSS is used to alter the rendering.

Horizontal and Verticle are treated differently.
  * We never scroll horizontally

# Mobile Or Web

Web clients are usually for internal uses

Mobile clients are usually end users
  * Create a layout for mobile first
    * forces you to make the tough decisions early on
  * Extend the layout for larger screen after

# Tools for Mobile Webs

## View Ports
Theres a meta viewport tag that goes between the head section

## Unites

em is relative to the container parent. 1.2 em is 20% bigger than the font.


```css
article {
  font-size: 20pt
}

article h2 {
  font-size: 1.2em
}
```
rem is relative to the root.

# SASS

```scss
// Setting up variables for CSS colors

// Can change the color without changing all of the elements.
